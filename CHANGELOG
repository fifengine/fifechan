* Added the possibility for horizontal scrolling.
* Added isSetVisible() to the Widget class. It's very similar to isVisible()
	but ignores the parent.
* Added GuiDeathListener. That should prevent crashes if the widget is hidden
  and removed on the same pump.
* Added ${LIB_SUFFIX} for CMake lib path. Can be used via -DLIB_SUFFIX argument.
* Fixed a segfault that could happen if the Widgets are destroyed after the Gui.

* Correct CMake SDL_ttf module name by Christopher Meng
* Setting the selected property of dropdowns to a value < 0 now
	will make them deselect the current item.
* Fixed extensions not being built with the correct export definition.
	This will fix undefined references when linking
	with the created shared libraries.
* Changed cmake options to enable contrib extensions for sdl and opengl
	to be OFF by default.
* OGLFTFone is now compiled into fifechan. It can be enabled or disabled
	by setting the cmake option ENABLE_OPENGL_CONTRIB to ON or OFF.
	It is enabled by default.
* Fixed SDLTrueTypeFont not included by CMake. It can be disabled by setting
	ENABLE_SDL_CONTRIB to OFF, which defaults to ON.

There are already some important bug fixes and new features such as:
  * A Widget is now able to detect that the mouse enters it when a Widget above 
    it gets hidden and the mouse cursor was over it.
  * Text objects do not try to access rows if they are empty, which caused 
    crashes before.
  * Widgets now distribute events if their ancestors where shown/hidden.
  * UTF8 support for TextBox and TextField widgets.
  * Work is done in a separate branch to support auto-layouting in fifechan. 
    Needs to be improved and tested.
  * New widgets
    * Circular container, which implements a container that arranges its children
      in a circular fashion. (only available in the auto-layouting branch)
    * IconProgressBar, which implements a progressbar that uses images to show 
      progress.
    * PasswordField, which implements password input.
